# Collection Of Animations 
I created this project to hone my skills in HTML and CSS. <br>
I collected many different animations, the ideas of which I liked. <br>
Here you can find many different animations and get inspired for new ones. <br>
Animations are collected in compact cells for comfortable viewing from any device. <br>
Each animation has its own name and number for easy code reading.
## Project idea
I did not meet similar projects and decided to create it myself.  <br>
Often there is already an idea, but I'm too lazy to write code for the n-th time.  <br>
For this, this project is boring.
## Working with a project
At the moment the project is being developed. <br>
All code can be found in the corresponding folders. <br>
For feedback, you can write a comment or email me.
## Authorship
At the moment, I'm the only one working on the project. <br>
I take all my ideas to TikTok, Instagram and sites that impress me.
